sample test cases:

1. I was overlooked for a promotion despite having the necessary qualifications and experience. Instead, the promotion was given to a younger, less experienced colleague. I believe this decision was based on age discrimination.

2. I have been subjected to inappropriate comments and unwanted physical contact by my supervisor over the past few months. Despite reporting these incidents to HR, no action has been taken.

3. I was terminated from my job without any prior notice or a valid reason. My performance reviews were always positive, and I believe this dismissal is unjust.

4. My employer has changed my job role significantly without any formal discussion or agreement. This new role does not match my skills or job description.

5. I have noticed that employees of my race are frequently assigned menial tasks and are not considered for promotions or leadership roles. This has created a hostile work environment.
